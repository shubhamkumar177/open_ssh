Download the OpenSSH installation package for Windows Server 2016 from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases

Choose the appropriate version based on your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) and download the ZIP package.

Extract the contents of the ZIP package to a directory of your choice.

Open a PowerShell prompt with administrator privileges.

Navigate to the directory where you extracted the OpenSSH package.

Run the following commands to install OpenSSH:

powershell
Copy code
cd .\OpenSSH-Win64\
.\install-sshd.ps1
After the installation is complete, start the OpenSSH SSHD service:

powershell
Copy code
Start-Service sshd
To automatically start the OpenSSH SSHD service at system boot, run the following command:

powershell
Copy code
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'
To allow incoming SSH connections through the Windows Firewall, run the following command:

powershell
Copy code
New-NetFirewallRule -Name 'OpenSSH' -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22
Verify the SSH server is running and the firewall rule is enabled by running the following commands:

powershell
Copy code
Get-Service sshd
Get-NetFirewallRule -Name 'OpenSSH'
With these steps, you should be able to install and configure OpenSSH on Windows Server 2016. Again, I apologize for any confusion caused, and thank you for bringing it to my attention.
